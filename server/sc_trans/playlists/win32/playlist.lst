# This example playlist is used as the main playlist sc_trans will use to pick
# out the files it will use to create its output for the source we generate.
#
# Also remember to use the correct path format for the OS you are using and to
# ensure that the files you want to play are present in the location you choose
# e.g.
.\music\shoutcast.mp3
#
# In this example we will just assume that all of the files associated to the
# playlist are in one folder and all have an mp3 extension though there is no
# reason why you cannot explicitly specify files to use or to reference a tool.
# See sc_trans.txt - section 7.1 for more information on how playlists work.

# Remember to change this to reference the files you want to use when trying
# the sc_trans_playlist.conf example which is best tried with full length files
